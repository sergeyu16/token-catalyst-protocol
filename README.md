# Token-Catalyst Protocol

**Energy-Backed Digital Asset Infrastructure**

Token-Catalyst is a blockchain protocol designed to issue and manage digital tokens that are fully backed by the physical potential of energy generation through hydrogen-producing catalysts. It enables a new class of transparent, collateralized, and scalable digital assets.

## 🌍 Overview

- **Core Formula:**
  ```
  Catalyst = Token – Capital Storage + Hydrogen Production Capability + Power Generation Capability = Stored Electricity
  ```
- **Main Use Case:** Prove and tokenize the capacity of a verified installation (catalyst) to produce green energy
- **Token Standard:** ERC-20 (or ERC-1155 for multi-energy tiers)
- **Backing:** Energy-producing physical catalysts, validated via oracles or certified reports
